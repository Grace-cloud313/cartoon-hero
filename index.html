        <!--<h2>What's happening in Burma/Myanmar?</h2>
            <p>On February 1st, the Burmese military staged a coup and detained the country's democratically-elected leaders. As of March 28th, 459 lives have been taken by this illegal military terrorist group, and 2559 have been detained. Burma gained independence from a century of British colonization in 1948, and in 1962, the first military coup led by General Ne Win took place. Since then, Burma has suffered from over 50 years of military rule. Some major events include the 8888 uprisings of 1988 in which 3,000 - 10,000 students were killed, the Saffron Revolution of 2007, and the Rohingya genocide in 2017. The states of non-dominant ethnic groups have long been the targets of the most violent conflicts. The conflict in Karen State, which has been going on for 72 years since the end of British rule, has been called one of the world's "longest running civil wars". Burma has only experienced 10 years(2011-2021) under a civilian government, and only 5 under one that was democratically-elected(2015 - 2020).<br> 
            Burma's fight for democracy is a fight that has never stopped. Problems persisted even under the civilian government, which </p>-->

        <!--<p>"It was thanks to the peoples'<br>
        sacrifice that helped push<br>
        Myanmar towards a direction, a<br>
        movement and in 2015, we felt<br>
        hope.<br>
        <br>
        We acheived democracy and<br>
        although, we didn't quite yet<br>
        know what that entailed, we<br>

        <br>-->
        "Myanmar is not perfect, we are<br>
        well aware. We were a country<br>
        left unfinished and broken by<br>
        war. We were still learning what<br>
        it meant to do democracy<br>
        correctly.<br>
        <br>
        What we do know is what was<br>
        done on February 1, 2021 stole<br>
        our hope and left the nation<br>
        with clipped wings."<br>

        <p>----------------</p>
        <!--<p>"What kind of hardships unfolded<br>
        when Myanmar received crumbs of<br>
        democracy in the form of a constitution<br>
        from a military that never truly cared,<br>
        <br>
        as though they were feeding starving birds,<br>
        saying "here you go, isn't this enough?"<br>
        but never giving enough food<br>
        to go around to the rest of the birds.<br>
        <br>
        How can a person who only obstructs freedom<br>
        possibly understand the mere concept of democracy?
        <br>
        And ultimately, perhaps it was inevitable<br>
        for such a revolution like this to occur.<br>
        <br>
        For we are cleansing this land to be rid of<br>
        violence and greed,<br>
        to be rid of Burmanization,<br>
        to be rid of autocrats who live by taking,<br>
        to be rid of exclusivity and invite inclusivity.<br>
        <br>
        Because these are the truths my friends:<br>
        <br>
        There is only right or wrong here.<br>
        There is only the side of freedom<br>
        and those who try to destroy it.<br>
        There is a good or bad.<br>
        You are either in or you're out.<br>
        You make the choice.<br>
        You are the power.<br>
        <br>
        They, who point their guns at us,<br>
        should feel lucky that our people are kind,<br>
        that we are looking for peace, and not violence,<br>
        <br>
        even after they've lived off of blood money,<br>
        off of the people in Rakhine whom they've massacred,<br>
        off of the people in Karen whom they've murdered,<br>
        off of the people in Kachin whom they've attacked,<br>
        off of the people of Mandalay whom they've killed,<br>
        off of the back of Ma Myat Thwe Thwe Khaing,<br>
        off of the back of Ko Thet Naing Win,<br>
        off of the back of Wai Yan Tun,<br>
        off of the back of the two children they burnt.<br>
        <br>
        Although we may not have guns that were born to kill and<br>
        tanks that can shoot thousands in a minute,<br>
        <br>
        we have phones in our hands, and our words will be our<br>
        bullets, and our minds the ammo and we will point it at those<br>
        who steal our futures.<br>
        <br>
        To the world watching from outside, I hope you<br>
        are seeing the beauty of Myanmar.<br>
        <br>
        For more than a million people from cities,<br>
        villages, areas big or small are uniting beyond all<br>
        backgrounds of race, gender, income, and age,<br>
        even those who've suffered more pain than<br>
        others, are still standing,<br>
        <br>
        And we hope you continue watching over us.<br>
        <br>
        For we've only just begun.<br>
